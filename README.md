Baja SAE Supply Chain Optimization & Decision Support System

This project documents the design and implementation of a structured inventory optimization and procurement decision-support system for a student-led manufacturing team.

The Baja SAE team operated in a high-pressure vehicle build environment where informal part tracking created stockout risk, financial opacity, and procurement inefficiencies. I developed a centralized inventory and replenishment framework managing 130+ SKUs across multiple subsystems (drivetrain, suspension, brakes, fabrication).

The system integrates:

ABC Analysis to prioritize high-value and long-lead-time components

Reorder Point (ROP) and Safety Stock policies to reduce stockout risk

Lead Time and Vendor Performance analysis to identify procurement bottlenecks

Financial Exposure tracking across $56K+ in inventory value

SDS compliance monitoring to ensure shop-floor safety documentation

Built using structured Excel tables, XLOOKUP, PivotTables, and interactive dashboards, the system transforms reactive purchasing into a proactive, data-driven replenishment strategy.

Impact:

Improved budget transparency and subsystem-level cost visibility

Reduced procurement risk through lead-time prioritization

100% Safety Data Sheet compliance

This project demonstrates the application of supply chain management principles — inventory control, buffer management, sourcing analytics, and operational risk mitigation — within a real manufacturing environment.
